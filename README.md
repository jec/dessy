# Dessy

This is Dessy (pronounced DEZ-ee), a ***DE***cision ***S***upport ***SY***stem.
The goal of this project is to provide the following:

* A DSL to model a decision domain, including value types, decision trees and
  terminology mapping
* A decision tree traverser

Stretch goals include:

* RESTful API access to the decision tree traverser
* RESTful API access to the terminology mapper

## Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it
with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.
